# EECS-4414-Assignment-1-Network-Models-and-Measurements

This program generates 3 graphs for 3 different graph types. The graph types are: Erdős-Rényi random graph model, Watts–Strogatz small-world graph model, and Barabási–Albert preferential attachment model. 

The following graph measurements were reported as well:
1) The node degree distribution of the graph (as a plot)
2) The distribution of the local clustering coefficient of the nodes of the graph (as a plot)
3) The global clustering coefficient of the graph (a number)
4) The average shortest path length of the graph (a number)
5) the diameter of the graph (a number)
